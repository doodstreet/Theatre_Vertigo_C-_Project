# Theatre_Vertigo_C#_Project
Hi, my name is Dave Street. I completed Software Developer Boot Camp and earned my certification from The Tech Academy. This was an intership experience  with Prosper I.T. Consulting. This project was a great experience for me using Agile/Scrum methodologies during this two week sprint.

Working with C# on Theatre Vertigo website completing these tasks:
- Create a New User easy login for development purposes.
- Create a new Donation Model table in the database with a one to many relationship between the AppUser (or Donor) and Donation including a timestamp at time of donation.
- Create an Admin field for a visiting theatre companyâ€™s name to be displayed in the About section and be easily updated as desired. This included helping to phase out an older reader method and update using Json properties instead.
- Create a new Rental History Model table in the database with a fully defined one to many relationship between the AppUser (or Renter) and Rental History.
