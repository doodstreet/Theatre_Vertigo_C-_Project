# Theatre_Vertigo_C#_Project
Hi, my name is Dave Street. I completed Software Developer Boot Camp and earned my certification from The Tech Academy. This was an intership experience  with Prosper I.T. Consulting. This project was a great experience for me using Agile/Scrum methodologies during this two week sprint.

Working with C# on Theatre Vertigo website completing these tasks:
- Create a New User easy login for development purposes.

- Create a new Donation Model table in the database with a one to many relationship between the AppUser (or Donor) and Donation including a timestamp at time of donation. Here is a code sample:
```
namespace TheatreCMS.Models
{
    public class Donation
    {
        public Donation()  // donation constructor
        {
            DonationTime = DateTime.Now;    //with dateTime at instatiation of object
        }

        [Key]                                    // primary key
        public int DonationId { get; set; }
        public DateTime DonationTime { get; set; }
        public int Amount { get; set; }

        public ApplicationUser Donor { get; set; }  // set foreign key to ApplicationuUser id with Donor
    }
}
```
- Create an Admin field for a visiting theatre companyâ€™s name to be displayed in the About section and be easily updated as desired. This included helping to phase out an older reader method and update using Json properties instead.

- Create a new Rental History Model table in the database with a fully defined one to many relationship between the AppUser (or Renter) and Rental History. Here is a code sample of that:
```
namespace TheatreCMS.Models
{
    public class RentalHistory
    {
        [Key]
        public int RentalHistoryId { get; set; }

        public ApplicationUser Renter { get; set; }
        public Rental Rental { get; set; }
        public int RentalId { get; set; }
        public bool RentalDamaged { get; set; }
        public string DamagesIncurred { get; set; }

    }
}

```
