# Theatre_Vertigo_C#_Project
<p>Hi, my name is Dave Street. I completed Software Developer Boot Camp and earned my certification from The Tech Academy. This was an intership experience  with Prosper I.T. Consulting. This project was a great experience for me using Agile/Scrum methodologies during this two week sprint.
